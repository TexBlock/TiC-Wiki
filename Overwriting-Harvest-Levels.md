The harvest level names displayed in TiC can be overwritten by providing a localization file (via Resource Pack) with the following entries:

> ui.mininglevel.X=Unobtanium

where X stands for the corresponding harvest level.

**HOWEVER** to use the feature you need to start at 0 (stone), and all entries up to X have to be present, e.g.

`
ui.mininglevel.0=Stone
ui.mininglevel.1=Copper
ui.mininglevel.2=Iron
ui.mininglevel.3=Diamond
ui.mininglevel.4=Cobalt
ui.mininglevel.5=Manyullyn
ui.mininglevel.6=Unobtanium
