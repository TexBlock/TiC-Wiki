## How do I craft X?

Download [Just Enough Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei). It allows viewing nearly all recipes in the mod. Until in game documentation is done, it is the best way to determine recipes.

Note that you can view recipes for tool parts (including in the part builder and casting), melting recipes, alloying, and entity melting. In addition, you can look up modifier recipes by looking up usage on a tool, or view all recipe tabs.

## How do I make the stencil table and tool parts?

The stencil table was merged with the part builder in an interface similar to the stonecutter. This means you can craft tool parts using only the part builder instead of needing two blocks.

## How do I add luck to my tool?

First, refer back to [How do I craft X?](#how-do-i-craft-x) and actually use JEI to look up recipes. If you still are confused, you can use the recipe below, but seriously, learn to use JEI if you are going to play mods.

## How do I craft large tools like the hammer? Where is the tool forge?

The tool forge was replaced with the Tinker's Anvil. Combine any 3 metal alloy blocks and 4 seared blocks to create an upgraded tool station that can craft all broad tools.

## How do I craft a smeltery controller?

First, create a seared melter and place it above either a seared heater or a seared tank filled with lava. Next, use it to melt 4 ingots worth of molten copper, and pour those on a seared heater in a casting basin. Note after melting the copper, you can immediately reuse the heater you used to melt the copper. 

## How do I get cobalt ore?

Cobalt ore is found in the nether at lower elevations. You need a tool with a mining level level of diamond or higher to mine it. This can be accomplished using materials such as tinker's bronze, pig iron, slimesteel, and nahuatl. Alternatively, you can use the diamond modifier to boost a tools mining level.

## How to I craft manyullyn or other nether alloys?

In order to craft manyullyn, you need to alloy cobalt with molten debris. Melting ancient debris and alloying manyullyn, hepatizon, or queens slime requires use of a hotter fuel such as molten blaze in place of lava. For best results, either create a second smeltery or remove all lava from the smeltery.

## How do I get molten blaze?

There are three ways to get molten blaze:

* Melt a blaze in a smeltery or foundry. You can do this either by carrying the blaze with tools such as the piggybackpack, or by building a smeltery or foundry under a spawner. Note you cannot have the spawner in the smeltery, it must be outside the structure.
* Apply the melting modifier to a tool using the recipe shown below, then use it to attack blazes. This will cause the tool to fill with molten blaze, which can then be used on a seared tank or a smeltery drain to empty it.
* When bartering with piglins, they have a chance to offer a scorched lantern filled with molten blaze. This lantern can be emptied into any regular tanks

## How do I get molten blaze out of my smeltery?

You can either use a bucket on the drain, or use a faucet to fill either a casting table containing a bucket or a tank.

## How to I use the alloyer?

The alloyer must be place above a scorched tank or a heater. Additional tanks or melters must be placed on the sides or top. The side and top tanks are filled with alloy inputs, and the alloyer itself will be filled with the alloyed fluid.

## What is the foundry? How do I build the foundry?

The foundry is an alternative to the smeltery for melting items and entities. Unlike the smeltery, it cannot alloy, however ores melted in the foundry produce byproducts, and the structure has a higher capacity for fluid.

To build the foundry, you need to use scorched blocks instead of seared blocks, and the structure must include the corners, as shown in the image below.
