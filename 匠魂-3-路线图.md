## Before beta

This section contains features that we want done before the final 1.16 update, and before the mod is marked as beta. It will ensure the mod is mostly stable moving on. After the first beta release, the API should remain stable, so making addons will be a lot easier.

### Documentation

**Datapacks**

* Document material creation
* Verify which recipe formats are documented so far

### Resources

**Worldgen**

* Update ender slime island foliage to a chorus like plant
* Added purple end slimewood variant. No logs, just planks will be available

### Tools

**Possible tool types**

Tools that I would like to include, but may not make it before the first beta

* Bows/crossbows
* Shield
* Battle Sign

**Materials**

* Tier 1: Chorus (partially implemented as slimeshells use it to repair)
* Tier 2: End Stone

**Modifiers**

* Mending
    * New general ability
    * Requires something from the end to craft, or maybe soul forge
    * Tool repairs on XP pickup
* Blocking
    * Battle sign ability as a modifier
    * If used on a battle sign, upgrades to full blocking like shields

### Smeltery

* Ability to pour non-forge fluid containers into tanks and drains
    * Implement using a datapack registry (possibly recipes) to produce a mapping from itemstack to fluid + container.
    * Possibly allow the inverse, or leave that to datapacks.

### Compat

* Immersive Engineering compat between spilling and chemical thrower
